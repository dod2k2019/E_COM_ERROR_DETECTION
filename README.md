# E_COM_ERROR_DETECTION
Mixing Data analytics on Text (maybe title or description of the SKU) and product Picture ::) 
This project saw day of the light when one of my flame buoyant friend in data science service industry discussed it over the series of text messages. 
Basically a ML based solution error detection in e-com sites and app. 
# So Basically two things
1. for example an SKU snap shows orange color toy, while the title/ description or heading appears to suggest grey.
2. Is it un-structured data, may be yes as text and images will swing into action?
